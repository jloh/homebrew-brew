# Homebrew Taps

These are just some homebrew taps that aren't in the main repo I want to use.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install jloh/brew/<formula>`

Or `brew tap jloh/brew` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
